              It provides support and encouragement for those students who are
              seeking a creative break in addition to their academic
              schedule.ArtClubLogo The club was inaugurated on 27th September,
              2019 on the auspicious occasion of Freshersâ€™ Welcome 2019. It was
              indeed a proud moment for the entire TINT family when the banner
              of AESTHETICA was held high by club members and other eminent
              dignitaries on the dais: Dr. R. T. Goswami, Director TINT, Dr.
              Swarup Prasad Ghosh, Registrar, TINT, Dr. Mala Mitra, HOD, BSH,
              TINT and Dr. Papiya Debnath, Convener, AESTHETICA, TINT. On this
              auspicious occasion, Dr. R. T. Goswami in his address mentioned
              that the Art Club of TINT proposes to capture the inherent talent
              and potentiality of the student community and also to uphold the
              artistic merits of the students who would in turn bring laurels to
              the organization through their constant efforts.
            </p>
            <p>AESTHETICA would encourage students to express their thoughts, feelings and creativity freely through drawing, sketching and painting. It would further motivate students to actively participate or be directly involved in art competitions. One of the major activities of the club would be to establish art club representatives to help manage and plan activities, and organize group projects. The club would also organize seminar, competitions and workshop for aesthetic enrichment of the students. At the same time the club is also looking forward to organize enrichment outing to a museum, art gallery, or figure drawing session in a year.</p>
